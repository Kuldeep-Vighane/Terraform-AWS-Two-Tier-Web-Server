# Terraform-AWS-Two-Tier-Web-Server
This project provisions a two-tier web server architecture on AWS using Terraform and a custom user-data shell script. It deploys two EC2 instances running Apache web servers, places them behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB), and serves a dynamically generated webpage showing EC2 instance metadata.
